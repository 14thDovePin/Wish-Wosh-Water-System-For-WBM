TODO List
- Update to not use `delay` function.

- Remove most string concatination.
- Implement warning for no clock module.
- Implement memory saving tips.
- Fix data saving of sensor output.
  + SprayCounter_1
  + SprayCounter_2
  + SprayCounter_3
  + SprayCounter_4
- Extend cycles to 5s in the final output.

- ?Implement setClock flag.
    This feature should only run once by creating a file when
    it has never ran. Then the consecutive runs will check for
    said file if the clock has been set or not. And to reset the
    system, just delete the file itself.
- ?Add a file backup system for power outage.
- ?Fix cycles, don't use delay, use millis instead.
- ?Break out into multiple files.


Added test and setting software for the clock module.

Changes
- Refactored `testSDModule.ino` to integrate `main.ino`.
- Updated `testDSMoule.ino` to include missing parts.
- Added new file `testClockModule.ino` in its own directory
  and is based from `main.ino`.
- Updated csv headers in `testSDModule.ino`.
- Updated `set_time.py`.
- Added new file `setClock.ino` in its own directory. This
  is a stand alone program that should only be used for
  recallibrating the Clock Module.



Changes
- Roughly copied the spine of `Wish-Wosh-Water-System-For-WBM.ino`
 to `main.ino` in its own directory.
`testSDModule.ino`
- Added ability to save both the data and log files.
- Refactored code.



Added test for the micro sd card module.

Changes
- Copied and refactored code regarding sd card module from
  `Wish-Wosh-Water-System-For-WBM.ino` to `testSDModule.ino`.
- Moved test `.ino` files into their own directories for
  isolated testing and execution.
- Changed function name `createCSVfile` -> `createFiles`.
- Refactored code in both afforementioned files.



Cleaned & manage String concatination.

Changes

- Implemented an initial routine for the atomizer.
- Added a new flag for testing the atomizers `skipAtmozerTest`.
- Changed how opening and closing file works.
- Fixed `printLog` disappearing logs.
- Deprecated `parseDigits`
- Refactored code.



Cleaned code, removed unecessary parts.

Changes
- Fixed headers.
- Commented out `parseDigits`.
- Excluded anything clock module related.

- Refactored code.



Implemented logging system.

Changes
- Added the following function/s:
  + printLog
- Modified `createCSVfile` function to also create a log file.
- Replaced almost all `Serial.println` functions with `printLog`.
- Added a debugging flag.



Implemented clock module.

Changes
- Modified `README.md`.
-
- Added the following function/s:
  + clockModuleInitialize
  + clockModuleRequest
  + clockModuleSet
  + getCurrentDT
  + parseDigits
- Created a new Python file `set_time.py`.
- Code for `set_time.py` written by ChatGPT.
- Refactored code.



Added CSM callibration flag.

Changes
- Removed "%" from the data pulled from CSM Sensor.
- Modified `README.md`.
- Added callibration flag `callibrateCSMS`.



Fixed CSM Sensor error handling.

Changes
- Fixed error handling of `pullCSMData`.
- Fixed string mismatch.
- Refactored code.



Restructured and refactored code.

Changes
-Renamed the following functions:
  + check_sdcm > checkSDCM
  + pd_th_sensor > pullTHData
  + pd_th_sensor_error > invalidTHData
  + read_csm_data > pullCSMData
  + csm_sensor_error_indicator_ > invalidCSMData
  + store_data > storeData
- Updated csv headers.

Implemented capacitive soil moisture module.

Changes
- Fixed memory leak that causes a crash in `pd_th_sensor`.
- Added the following function/s:
  + read_csm_data
  + createFileError
- Renamed the following functions:
