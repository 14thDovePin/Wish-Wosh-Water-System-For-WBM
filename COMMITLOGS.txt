TODO List
- Add a file backup system for power outage.
- Add time of print to `printLog`.
- Implement setClock flag.
    This feature should only run once by creating a file when
    it has never ran. Then the consecutive runs will check for
    said file if the clock has been set or not. And to reset the
    system, just delete the file itself.
- Extend cycles to 5s in the final output.
- ?Fix cycles, don't use delay, use millis instead.
- ?Break out into multiple files.
